_Tutorial description if there is one:_

From Scrimba courses and tutorials in [The Frontend Career Path](https://scrimba.com/fullstack-path-c0fullstack)

https://miragejs.com/ - Set a mockup server that intercepts API calls - TO get the Van's info.

/**
 * Challenge: set up the BrowserRouter and Routes!
 * Note: nothing will render to the page yet.
 */


/**
 * Challenge:
 * 1. Create an "About" component (just render another h1 that says
 *    "About page" or something more interesting of your choosing).
 * 2. Create a new Route to render the About component when the path
 *    is /about
 */





 /**
 * Challenge:
 * Bootstrap the VanLife project by creating the first 2 routes:
 * Home and About.
 * 
 * Also include the navbar that can link between the two routes.
 * For now, you'll either need to copy/paste the navbar code
 * to both Home and About pages, or you'll need to find a place
 * to put it where it can be shared between the two pages.
 * (Don't overthink this part - just do whatever is easiest for
 * you because we'll learn a better approach very soon)
 * 
 * Review challenge: do all the CSS yourself based on the design
 * linked in the slides.
 */

 


 /**
 * Challenge: Create the Vans list page, Route, and Link
 * 
 * 1. Create a Vans component in the "pages" directory. For now,
 *    just render <h1>Vans page goes here üöê</h1>
 * 2. Create a Route for the Vans page on the /vans route
 * 3. Add a Link in the nav bar to the Vans route
 */



 /**
 * Challenge: Fetch and map over the data to display it on
 * the vans page. For an extra challenge, spend time styling
 * it to look like the Figma design.
 * 
 * Hints:
 * 1. Use `fetch("https://api/vans")` to kick off the request to get the
 *    data from our fake Mirage JS server
 * 2. What React hook would you use to fetch data as soon as the
 *    Vans page loads, and only fetch it the one time?
 * 3. You may get an error saying "console.groupCollapsed is not
 *    a function". You can ignore it for now.
